# 🏆 Challenge Tournament Platform

## 📌 Overview

The **Challenge Tournament Platform** is a robust backend application for managing programming challenge tournaments. Built with **Kotlin and Spring Boot** using Hexagonal Architecture, it provides:

- 👥 Player management
- 🏅 Tournament organization
- 🎯 Technical challenge execution
- 📊 Automated ranking system

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 👤 Players
- ✅ Create, update, and delete players
- 🔍 Search by ID or name
- 🔄 Unique name validation

### 🏟️ Tournaments
- 🗓️ Create with name and date
- ➕/➖ Add/remove players
- 📋 List participants
- 🔒 Finalize (locks modifications)

### 🧩 Technical Challenges

| Challenge       | Weight | Description                          |
|-----------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| **Fibonacci**   | 10pts  | Efficient nth-term calculation       |
| **Palindrome**  | 5pts   | Case/punctuation-insensitive check   |
| **Sorting**     | 8pts   | Custom implementation (no `.sorted()`)|

### 📈 Ranking System
- 🌍 **Global** (lifetime scores)
- 🏟️ **Per Tournament**
- ⏫ Automatic updates

### 🔌 Key Ports (Interfaces)
- `PlayerRepositoryPort` - Player data operations
- `TournamentRepositoryPort` - Tournament management
- `ChallengeRepositoryPort` - Challenge execution tracking
- `RankingRepositoryPort` - Score calculations

### 📚 Domain Models
- `Player`: Represents tournament participants
- `Tournament`: Competition with start/end dates
- `Challenge`: Problem definitions (Fibonacci, Palindrome, Sorting)
- `ChallengeExecution`: Record of player attempts
- `Ranking`: Score tracking system

## 📦 Deployment

### Script-based Deployment

The project includes a `run.sh` script for easier deployment and environment setup. Before using the script, ensure it has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
```

#### Deployment Commands
- **Database Setup**: Deploy the database container:
  ```bash
  ./run.sh database
  ```
- **Development Mode**: Start the application in development mode (requires the database to be running):
  ```bash
  ./run.sh dev
  ```
- **Production Mode**: Containerize and start the application in production mode:
  ```bash
  ./run.sh prod
  ```

Use the appropriate command to match your desired environment.

## 📈 Test Coverage

### Test Coverage Percentage

With the implementation of these tests, the application's test coverage is expected to reach approximately **90-95%**. The main areas that may not be fully covered include:

- Specific validations within services
- Edge cases in certain methods
- More complex integration tests

### Steps to Achieve 100% Coverage

To achieve full coverage, the following additional steps are required:

- Implement tests for all exception cases
- Test all edge scenarios
- Add integration tests that cover the complete flow between controllers, services, and repositories
- Test all methods in all components

The provided tests, however, cover the vast majority of the application's core functionalities and use cases.
